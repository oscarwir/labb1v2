A text file so we easily can break down what we have to do, and then be able
to assign different tasks to each other.

Things that are outdated in the code and should get fixed:
-Fix comments so that they are correct (A)
-Make everything organized with folders (is it possible?) (O)
-Create new test files for everything (J)

Things that are currently in progress:

The next steps in the assignment:



(O) - Oscar
(A) - Adam
(J) - Jacob
(U) - Unassigned


We can defend our way by using high cohesion as an argument

We should write descriptions to all our tests

Is it better code to have constructors in each test file that initiates each object?

gorilla banana problem with our code.

The very last thing is to check every file for unused imports
