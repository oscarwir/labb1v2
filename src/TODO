A text file so we easily can break down what we have to do, and then be able
to assign different tasks to each other.

Things that are outdated in the code and should get fixed:
-Fix comments so that they are correct (U)
-Change all AutoVehicleGetTest and AutoVehicleSetTest to vehicle (U)
-Make everything organized with folders (jeez) (U)

Things that are currently in progress:
-Change Pointdouble with <> (U)


The next steps in the assignment:



(O) - Oscar
(A) - Adam
(J) - Jacob
(U) - Unassigned


We can defend our way by using high cohesion as an argument
